<p>The <b>System.Reflection.Emit</b> namespace provides classes to create dynamic assemblies at runtime.
It allows compilers and tools to emit <b>MSIL</b>, execute it and store it to a disk.
Although <b>Emit</b> is a powerful tool, it is also extremely hard to use.</p>
<p>BLToolkit provides a helper class, <a href='/Source/Reflection/Emit/EmitHelper.cs.htm'>EmitHelper</a>,
which can make your life a little bit easy.
It contains typed wrapper methods for almost all emit commands and allows writing source code
that looks similar to <b>MSIL</b>.</p>
<p>The following examples show how to use the EmitHelper class with C#, VB.NET, and C++/CLI.</p>
