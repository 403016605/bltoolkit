    Note: Changes classification
    - Create
    - Refactoring
    - Bug Fix
    - Upgrade (reason can be: new requirement, changed requirements, code upgrade)
    Note: Date is when the change is completed
2 - If you add or change messages in messages.resx compile "comment" column:
    write in the file name where the added/changed message is used and write the author (your name)
3 - Possibly write tests before start coding
4 - Use MS help docs to check the expected behavior for the struct you are
    implementing
5 - Use Anakrino to see the MS implementation of the corrisponding built-in type and SqlType
6 - Write XML tag documentation (use MS documentation of SqlTypes as baseline)
