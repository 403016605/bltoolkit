v 2.0.3

Bug fixes

- Race condition in MappingSchema.GetObjectMapper.
- DbManager will not try to close the connection in the finalizer anymore.
- MinValue/MaxValue attributes now determine value type by object property/field instead of test value.
- Fixed obscure case when object is removed from EditableArrayList/BindingListImpl while ItemPropertyChanged 
  delegate is in process of being executed and collection handler was not yet invoked.

Enhancement

- HttpReader SOAP support.
- Convert<T,P> uses type cast operators when available.
- Third party DataProvider registration via appsettings.
- More specification adherent sorting behavior implementation of IBindingList/IBindingListView in BindingListImpl. 
- EditableArrayList (potentially breaking changes) heavily relies on BindingListImpl for IBindingList/IBindingListView 
  and their base interfaces implementation. 
- BindingListImpl is changed to be fully specification adherent binding wrapper for other object lists/collection types.
